Hello!

Thank you for signing up for the Montreal Python Workshop taking place
this weekend, February 22-23. The purpose of this email is to confirm
your attendance and make sure you bring what is necessary. So please
read it carefully and reply with answers to each question below.

* Are you able to spend Friday evening (6:00pm until 9:00pm) and all
  day Saturday (9:30am until 4:30pm) at the workshop?

* Do you have a laptop computer that you can bring for the entire
  workshop?

* Are you able to install software on that laptop?

* What operating system is that laptop running? (E.g. "Mac OS X 10.6",
  "Windows 7", "Ubuntu 12.04", ...)

* Do you have any special dietary requirements? (Lunch on Saturday is
  courtesy of the Python Software Foundation.)

The workshop will be at Notman House, 51 Sherbrooke St West, at the
corner with Clark. The building is undergoing some renovations, so do
not be alarmed if the front door looks a little worn. It's fine
inside, come right in. ;-)

Friday evening is largely self-guided, and should take between two and
three hours. So it's OK if you don't show up until 6:30 or so. Note
that we're *not* providing food for Friday.

Saturday morning is more structured: the doors will open at 9:30, and
the lecture will start at 10:00 sharp. Please arrive on time!

One last thing: you may not have heard about it, but there's been a
big movement in the last couple of years to make the software industry
more diverse and more welcoming to newcomers. As part of that
movement, we have a formal code of conduct for this event which is
closely based on the code of conduct used for much larger conferences.
In a nutshell: don't be mean, don't laugh at people, and don't be a
jerk. If you can't follow those simple rules, we will ask you to
leave.

Thanks, and see you Friday!
